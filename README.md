## Usage
Just place the files you want inside the `dir` folder and pray to not get pwned since I would never trust php.

## Dependencies
PHP and a web server.

## Why?
I have no idea...

I saw something similar from someone showing his rice and it looked cool, so i'll probably use this to show my rice too.
